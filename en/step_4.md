## Challenge: Pick your own colours

Using your `setButtonColour` function try changing the colour of the button to some of these:
  - Green
  - Purple
  - Yellow

Changing the values of `red`, `green`, and `blue` that you pass to `setButtonColour` will change the colour of the button.

--- hint ---
Colour values go from `0` to `255`. You're mixing light, not paint, so some of the results might not be what you expect!

--- hint ---
Green is one of the three primary colours you're mixing. Purple and yellow can be found by mixing two of the three in equal amounts.
