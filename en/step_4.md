## Challenge: pick your own colours

Use your `setButtonColour` function to change the colour of the button to, for example:
  - Green
  - Purple
  - Yellow

Changing the values of `red`, `green`, and `blue` that you pass to `setButtonColour` changes the colour of the button.

--- hint ---
Colour values go from `0` to `255`. Note that you are mixing colours of light, not colours of paint, so some of the results might not be what you expect!

Green is one of the three primary colours you're mixing. To create purple and yellow, mix two of the three primary colours in equal amounts.
