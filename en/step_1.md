## Introduction

In this project you'll be learning JavaScript â€” one of the world's most popular programing languages. You probably use things built with it every day. It's in every major website, including YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and Google. It's also in lots of mobile apps and games.

### What you will make

You'll be making this colour guessing game, where the player gets to see the RGB (red, green, blue) values of a colour and guess which of the six options they're shown matches it.

Click on colours to guess, then use the reset button to change the colours and start a new game!
